# Image Sequencer Compressor

## Description
The `SequencerCompressorV0.7.py` is a Python script designed for efficient management of large image collections. It searches through nested directories for sequential image files and compresses them into ZIP files, while also cleaning up the directory by retaining only the first image in each sequence.

## Features
- **Automated Scanning**: The script automatically scans directories for sequential images.
- **Compression**: Compress image sequences into ZIP files to save disk space.
- **Clutter Reduction**: After compression, the script deletes all but the first image in each sequence, reducing clutter.
- **Flexible Naming Patterns**: Supports various naming patterns of image files.
- **Multilingual Support**: The script is available in English, Turkish, and Arabic.

## New in Version 0.7
- **Enhanced Compression**: Improved image compression algorithms for higher efficiency.
- **Performance Boost**: Faster scanning and compression, making it ideal for large image collections.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A graphical user interface (GUI) for easier script execution.
- **Detailed Reports**: The script now provides detailed reports on the compression process.
- **Additional Language Support**: Added support for Arabic language.
- **Bug Fixes**: Various bug fixes and stability improvements.

## Extended Description
Managing a large collection of image sequences can be a daunting task, especially when disk space is a concern. The Image Sequencer Compressor script aims to simplify this process and help you regain valuable storage space.

**Automated Scanning**: The script takes care of the tedious task of scanning directories for image sequences. It identifies sequential images and prepares them for compression.

**Efficient Compression**: With improved compression algorithms, version 0.7 ensures that your images are compressed with minimal loss of quality. This not only saves space but also speeds up file transfers.

**Clutter Reduction**: Large image collections often lead to cluttered directories. This script automatically deletes redundant images in a sequence, retaining only the first image. This feature is particularly useful when working with animation frames or time-lapse photography.

**User-Friendly Interface**: Version 0.7 introduces a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience. You can now execute the script with just a few clicks.

**Detailed Reports**: Stay informed about the compression process with detailed reports. The script provides information about which images were compressed and where the resulting ZIP files are located.

**Multilingual Support**: In addition to English and Turkish, the script now supports the Arabic language, making it accessible to a wider audience.

**Bug Fixes and Stability**: We've addressed various issues and improved the script's stability to ensure a seamless experience.

This script is ideal for photographers, animators, and anyone dealing with a substantial amount of image sequences. It simplifies the process of managing and compressing images, freeing up space and making your projects more organized.
