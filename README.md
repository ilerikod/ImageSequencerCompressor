README - Image Sequencer Compressor
Description:
Image Sequencer Compressor is a Python application designed to search through directories for sequential images (e.g., image_00001.png, image_00002.png, etc.) and compress them into ZIP files if more than ten sequential images are found in a folder. After compression, all images except the first one are deleted to save space. This project is licensed under the MIT License.

How to Use:

Download ImageSequencerCompressor.exe or the source code (ImageSequencerCompressor.py).
If using the executable, place it in the root directory where you want to search for images. If using the source code, ensure Python 3 is installed on your system.
Open Command Prompt (CMD) and navigate to the directory containing the executable or source code.
Run the program by typing ImageSequencerCompressor.exe or python ImageSequencerCompressor.py and pressing Enter.
The program will search through all subdirectories and display folders with more than ten sequential images.
Confirm whether you want to compress these folders when prompted.
After compression, check the directory for the ZIP files and the first image.
